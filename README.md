## Abstract
Malnutrition is caused by a lack of sufficient nutrients in the diet, affecting the body's vital organs and functioning. 
Periodic examination and mass screening employ both traditional and non-invasive techniques. However, major drawbacks include the need for additional equipment, the lack of holistic feature representation, the absence of appropriate health indicators, and the unavailability of cloud-based smartphone implementation for estimating the Body Fat Percentage (BFP), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Body Mass Index (BMI) accurately for smart-malnutrition monitoring. To resolve these limitations, this study proposes a novel, scalable \& robust cloud-based smart malnutrition-monitoring system that uses a single full-body image of a person to estimate height, weight, and other intuitive health parameters in a multi-modal learning framework. 

## Contributions
- A holistic feature fusion of facial, body \& 3D embeddings, including the correlation between them, optimal feature combination and individual importance in estimating the weight is insightfully discussed.
- This paper is the first to incorporate the fine-grain local 3D representation in combination using 3D classification network backbones as feature extractors.
